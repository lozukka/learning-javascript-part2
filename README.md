# learning-javascript-part2

More of me learning javascript. I asked ChatGPT to draft me 15 projects based on the first 15 projects.

# Project 1: Stopwatch 2.0
User can start, stop and reset a stopwatch. Below the stopwatch is shown previous times, newest on top. It is also possible to reset the list. The list uses local storage to save times.

I learned:
- mentality: first make it work, then make it better
- nothing was particaly new to me, it was just a bigger project with multiple parts

# Project 2: Two dices
User can roll two dices and gets a combined result.

I learned:
- I have a hard time to figure out local storage.
- Used prepend to add list item to the top of the list instead of bottom of the list

# Project 2.5
Just a very simple and basic local storage structure. 

# Project 3: FAQ accordion
User can click questions, and then that answer is shown. Other answers are hidden.

I learned:
- refreash project about classList.toggle

# Project 4: Image slider
User can click buttons: next or previous, and then the image change.

I learned: 
- I learned to use index-numbers
- The main logic flow was a little difficult to figure out, but it slowly was coming together.

# Project 5: Traffic light
On the page is a box that changes color. User can stop and continue with the color changes.

I learned:
- state machine -model

# Project 6: Currency convertor
User can give an amount of euros that they want to convert to other currencies.

I feel like this project have repeative structures. I know that that is kind of normal with certain things. When you know the basics, you can do more complicate things with those basics.

# Project 7: Notes app
User can create, read, update and delete notes. This is also using local storage to save those notes.

I learned:
- CRUD stands for:
    C: Create
    R: Read
    U: Update
    D: Delete
- manage to do a local storage that worked!
- I added also CSS
- added images with js
- this felt a little bigger project but I also managed it

# Project 8: Random quotes
User can click a button and a random quote is shown on the page.

I used ChatGPT to create me a JSON file with 20 random quotes.

I learned:
- fech from JSON file
- creating a random index-number was easy
- I also learned how to add try and error to fetch

# learning-javascript-part2

More of me learning javascript. I asked ChatGPT to draft me 15 projects based on the first 15 projects.

# Project 1: Stopwatch 2.0
User can start, stop and reset a stopwatch. Below the stopwatch is shown previous times, newest on top. It is also possible to reset the list. The list uses local storage to save times.

I learned:
- mentality: first make it work, then make it better
- nothing was particaly new to me, it was just a bigger project with multiple parts
